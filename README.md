# UnitFramesImproved_Vanilla
Backport of UnitFramesImproved to Vanilla with some minor changes like dark mode and class portraits.

This backport is in Beta State and I would appreciate if you report any bugs you might find when using this addon.

<b>I recommend using MobInfo2 to be able to see mobs health/mana etc.</b>

<b>Dont forget to remove "-master" at the end of the filename when you add it to your interface folder.</b>

If you dont want to use dark mode you can simply delete line 1-55 in UnitFramesImproved_Vanilla.lua. I will add an option for this at a later point.
