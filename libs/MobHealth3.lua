	MobHealth3!
		"Man, this mofo lasts forever!" "Dude, it only has 700hp and you're a paladin -_-"

	By Neronix of Hellscream EU
		With tons of contributions by Mikk

	Special thanks to the following:
		Mikk for writing the algorithm used now, helping with the metamethod proxy and for some optimisation info
		Vika for creating the algorithm used in the frst 4 generations of this mod. Traces of it still remain today
		Cladhaire, the current WatchDog maintainer for giving me permission to use Vika's algorithm
		Ckknight for the pseudo event handler idea used in the second generation
		Mikma for risking wiping his UBRS raid while testing the really borked first generation
		Subyara of Hellscream EU for helping me test whether UnitPlayerControlled returns 1 for MC'd mobs
		Iceroth for his feedback on how to solve the event handler order problem in the first generation
		AndreasG for his feedback on how to solve the event handler order problem in the first generation and for being the first person to support MH3 in his mod
		Worf for his input on what the API should be like
		All the idlers in #wowace for testing and feedback

== MobHealth3:GetUnitHealth(unit[,current][, max][, name][, level]) ==
Returns the current and max health of the specified unit

=== Args ===
; unit : The unitID you want health for
; [current] : (optional) The value of UnitHealth(unit). Passing this if your mod knows it saves MH3 from having to call UnitHealth itself<br>
; [max] : (optional) The value of UnitHealthMax(unit). Passing this if your mod knows it saves MH3 from having to call UnitHealthMax itself<br>
; [name] : (optional) The name of the unit. Passing this if your mod knows it saves MH3 from having to call UnitName itself<br>
; [level] : (optional) The level of the unit. Passing this if your mod knows it saves MH3 from having to call UnitLevel itself

=== Returns ===
If the specified unit is alive, hostile and its true max health unknown, the absolute current and max value based on the cache's current entry<br>
If the specified unit's friendly or data was not found, returns UnitHealth(unit) and UnitHealthMax(unit)

A third return value is a boolean stating whether an estimation was found

=== Remarks ===
Remember, args 2-5 are optional and passing the args if your mod already knows them saves MH3 from having to find the data itself<br>
Don't pass level as a string. Please.<br>
MobHealth3 does the target-validty checking for you

=== Example ===
 function YourUnitFrames:UpdateTargetFrame()
 	local name, level = UnitName("target"), UnitLevel("target")
 	local cur, max, found
 	if MobHealth3 then
 		cur, max, found = MobHealth3:GetUnitHealth("target", UnitHealth("target"), UnitHealthMax("target"), name, level)
 	else
 		cur, max = UnitHealth("target"), UnitHealthMax("target")
